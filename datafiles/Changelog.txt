>>> New Physics Demo (0.3.2.2) <<<

 - More bug fixes
 - Very small quality of life updates have been made
 - Added shields and powerups. They're scattered away around all levels so you'll have to explore to find them.
   -> Includes:
	- All elemental shields (normal, fire, lightning, bubble)
	- Invincibility, super speed shoes, "Hyper Ring" from Sonic Mania

Yeah...that's it. Scoreboards didn't make it this time, sorry. Please consider this update as an apology for the abrupt inactivity
