# Sonic J

The official repository of Sonic J and its source code. This is where you can keep track of the game's current development, as well as assist on the process in any way possible through the website. **EVERY POST-RELEASE COMMIT SHOULD BE MADE IN THE POST-RELEASE BRANCH. Should a new release be published, that branch will merge will the main one lest the source messes up.**

The repository contains everything from the game, as you would normally expect from a GMS 1.4 project.

## Things to note
The respository was created in order to make it easier for developers and every other team members to manage the game as its progress continues. **_This repository will only be visible to development team members, trusted beta testers, and so on._**

**Note to all coders: the game itself is entirely made on GameMaker Studio 1.4, therefore the coding is prior to today's standards of GML. Should you work on the game with the latest instalment of GameMaker Studio 2, do so at your own risk.**

_Sonic the Hedgehog is owned by SEGA. I do not own the franchise as I am not affiliated with SEGA and Sonic Team. Soinic J is a non-profit fan game using and it should not be sold._
