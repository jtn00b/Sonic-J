# Sonic J
The official repository of Sonic J and its source code. This is where you can keep track of the game's current development, download the latest beta versions, and assist on the development process in any way possible through the website.

The repository contains everything from the game, as you would normally expect from a GMS 1.4 project.

**Note to all coders: the game itself is entirely made on GameMaker Studio 1.4, therefore the coding is prior to today's standards of GML. Should you work on the game with the latest instalment of GameMaker Studio 2, do so at your own risk.**

_Sonic the Hedgehog is owned by SEGA. I do not own the franchise as I am not affiliated with SEGA and Sonic Team. Soinic J is a non-profit fan game using and it should not be sold._
