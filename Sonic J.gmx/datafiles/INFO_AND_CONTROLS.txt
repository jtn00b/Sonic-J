Thanks for downloading Sonic J - New Physics Demo!

NOW READ:
PLEASE note that this version is only just an early phyiscs demonstration release, therefore it doesn't feature anything new or special ...yet. That means, do NOT expect the game to be any decent in terms of content, as the focus here is only the new physics framework.

Any feedback is appreciated and may potentially help for future releases.

By the time this version is released, a new final demo is in the works, which will represent the game in its truest shape. Story mode, actual levels, extra content, new mechanics, and more to come.

Also, did you know this game is playable on Android? You can check by yourself by clicking the GameJolt link above.

Anyway, thanks for downloading the game, again. U r 2 awsom B)
